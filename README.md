# SpacePop

Hey there! SpacePop was a project from my sophomore year in high school where I essentially tried to recreate Space Invaders but with slightly more modern looking sprites! Anyway, the project never got done because of covid, but if anyone would like to use my sprites or finish building the game, they can feel free to grab any of the work here.
